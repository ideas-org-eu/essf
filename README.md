# Ethical and Sustainable Search Framework (ESSF)

## Overview
The Ethical and Sustainable Search Framework (ESSF) is designed to integrate ethical and sustainability considerations into search technologies. It provides API endpoints for evaluating content, products, and services based on predefined ethical and sustainability criteria. The framework leverages AI models and data processing services to assess and rank search results, facilitating informed decision-making for users.

## Installation
To set up the ESSF project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ideas-org-eu/essf.git
   cd essf
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application
To run the Flask application which serves the API endpoints:
```
python api/app.py
```
This will start the server on `localhost:5000`, making the API accessible for local development and testing.

## API Usage
The ESSF provides the following API endpoints:
- **POST `/api/evaluate/ethics`**: Accepts JSON data and returns an ethics evaluation.
- **POST `/api/evaluate/sustainability`**: Accepts JSON data and returns a sustainability evaluation.

Example request using `curl`:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/evaluate/ethics -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": "test data"}'
```

## Testing
To run tests for the API endpoints, execute:
```
pytest
```
